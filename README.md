# Trello Test Scenarios

The purpose of this project was to practice identifying and writing test cases, using Trello checklists to seperate valid and invalid cases and make it possible to track test execution. Test cases were written for the Facebook sign up page (PC). [Trello card](https://trello.com/c/08Jm4Ibo).

I decided to repeat this project with an app that I was less familiar with, in order to further practice identifying test cases. For this, I chose to write test cases for UberEats, which has a different sign up process to Facebook. [Trello card](https://trello.com/c/QgURZJUW).
